# Dog Pictures App

This project is a simple application that fetches random dog pictures from  Dog API and displays them on the webpage. I chose this API because I love dogs and thought it would be fun to create a page that shows random dog pictures.

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Fetch Dog Picture" button to fetch and display a new random dog picture.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the webpage.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to fetch and display dog pictures.
